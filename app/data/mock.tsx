The passage mentions 'extraordinary social mobility' but 'narrowing of economic opportunity.'

While opportunity might have been high (greater) before 1750, it was *decreasing* after 1750, making 'greater economic opportunity... after 1750' problematic in a comparative sense within the century.

The passage states 'Social structure was in fact so fluid – though recent statistics suggest...' and 'to talk about social classes at all requires the use of loose economic categories.' 'Fluid' and 'loose categories' directly support the idea of non-rigid divisions. So, III is true.",

Statement II is difficult to reconcile with 'narrowing' but could be weakly argued as 'generally high despite decline' if interpreted broadly. Given that III is undeniably correct, and assuming there's a single best option, option (b) 'II and III only' is the most plausible choice if one allows for the weak inference in II, as I, IV are definitively false.",
